__Forking and cloning repo locally__
1. Fork the main repo: This can be done directly from the github ui.
2. Clone your forked repo locally: `git clone <path-to-your-forked-repo>`
3. Setup a link to main repo: `git remote add upstream <path-to-main-repo>`

From this point on, origin represents your forked repo, upstream represents the main repo.
